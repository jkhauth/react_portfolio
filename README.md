	<!--DESIGNING-->
	<tr>
		<td>
            <p>The foundation of the design of my portfolio was the menu to PSP handheld controller. I loved the fading in and simplicity of animations of switching between components of the menu and tried to replicate it with my own twist.</p>

            <p>In my about me page, I decieded to go with an old picture of myself using the computer to signify my passion with technology and that it has always been one of my passions. I detail my current and past interests to give an overall picture on who I am.</p>

            <p>My skills component displays my current and past accomplishments as an employee and leader of another industry. I am able to display my knowledge on different design programs, languages, and frameworks. The education is also included in this section to tie all of my skill and abilites together.</p>

    <tr>
		<td> 
            <p>When we get to the projects component, you are greated with all of my projects that I have accomplished. However, I did not hard code each project. I simply made a json file and created a "project API" where I could map over the json file to use a building block for the components. They are transitioned and fade away when off screen to implement lazy loading.</p>
